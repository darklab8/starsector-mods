When connected to the facility, it emits waves that smooth out the curvature of space-time through a specific frequency into the universe, interfering with gravity and linking to the ""deep space"" mentioned by Kesuras Borken, enabling the fleet to make a one-way space jump.

This device was abandoned by the Borken in various parts of the Persean Sector. As far as we can tell, the spatial turbulence they encountered while traveling through space forced them to abandon some of their cargo ships, which were loaded with special equipment similar to the Stabilizing Column of the God.
