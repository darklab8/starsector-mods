peaceful_evolution_mission,posting,,,posting,"Deliver $evolverNum $evolverName within $daysLeft days for a reward of $rewardCredits.","Assist the Foundation of Borken in analyzing the carbon-based life of this universe. Bring a battleship of the Foundation carrying $evolveBowlName into battle with you. After combat, a certain percentage of its crew will merge with the $evolveBowlName to become $evolverName. After completion of the task contact $contactDesc $contactName at $market to finalize the assignment.
Conversion details: To convert crew, the Borken ship has to inflict damage to an enemy ship’s hull and conversion rate depends on the crew count of the Borken ship. A sufficient quantity of $evolveBowlName is required. The conversion rate goes from 1% of the crew for just deployment to up to 100% if the damage inflicted by the Borken ship equals 2.5 times its own hull strength (If damage is lower than the ship’s hull, it receives a penalty). Conversion will automatically end should the amount of obtained $evolverName exceed double the required amount for the assignment. $evolveBowlName are automatically produced by Borken freighters.",,,,no_system_prefix,,
