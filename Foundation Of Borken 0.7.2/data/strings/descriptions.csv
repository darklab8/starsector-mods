FOB_basatan,SHIP,"Even amongst the highest ranks of the Borken, there are few that are capable of effectively controlling this demon of a ship. The Basatan is said to crush all that stand before it and is without doubt the most dangerous vessel constructed by the Foundation. Its aggressive nature is said to be troublesome for some captains, but if your intent is to bring it to bear against your enemies, that should not be an issue.",,,,
FOB_shuddemell,SHIP,"The most common battleship of the Borken, the ShuddeMell is an old design and regarded fondly by many Borken for having been with them since the beginning of their exile to our universe. While not exceptional in any particular way, it is a dependable vessel that is effective in most battlefield situations and is a match for any other battleship in the Persean Sector. It remains the backbone of the Borken navy to this day.",,,,
FOB_chaugnar,SHIP,"While the Borken Foundation is held in high regards by most businessmen, there are certain customers that desire an additional sense of safety for their goods, in particular those they do not wish to disclose. For these customers, the Foundation offers its massive fortress ships, heavily armed and armored megafreighters that can be leased and controlled remotely and anonymously through advanced untraceable encrypted point-to-point transmissions.",,,,
FOB_chthonian,SHIP,"Borken's most successful large destroyer gunship, the Chthonian-class, has been a formidable weapon since the rise of Cthulasus Borken. It is often deployed for tactical ambushes or as an escort for transporting vital equipment. Its powerful Grey Stab Mk.V pulse cannon can even penetrate the armor of heavy battleships, making fleets with large ships reluctant to attack Borken convoys. The potential repair costs far outweigh the value of any loot they might gain, even if they emerge victorious.",,,,
FOB_gnophkeh,SHIP,"The Borken Foundation’s most common combat freighter. Equipped with an integrated Greystab cannon, it boasts respectable firepower and can defend itself adequately. It is however still a freighter and its low speed and armor make it unsuitable for regular combat use. It is recommended to not deploy these into battle unless there is no other option.",,,,
FOB_tindalos,SHIP,"When the Borken arrived in this universe they found their old vessels to be quite unpopular with human customers. As a result a new line of small destroyer-class vessels were developed. While small and relatively fragile, the Tindalos has become popular for its cheap price, letting you buy a small fleets worth of firepower for the price of less than a battleship.",,,,
FOB_migo,SHIP,"A new destroyer developed from the dismantled engine section of an ancient warship, the Migo was designed to serve as an escort vessel as opposed to other, more aggressive Borken vessels of similar size and classification. Equipped with a specialized anti-fighter missile system and excellent weapons coverage, it is often seen in trade convoys to defend larger vessels.",,,,
FOB_dhole,SHIP,"This small combat vessel, named the Dhole, is built around an impressive Greystab Type-IV beam cannon. Considering the price of this weapon on the market, it would seem like an excellent deal for a fresh captain. Keep in mind though that this single weapon comprises almost the entirety of the ships combat capability and should you lose it, your career might meet a swift end.",,,,
FOB_shoggoth,SHIP,"The Shoggoth-class is the Foundation's premier combat freighter. Heavily armed and protected while also the first ship to be equipped with a Gary IV Pulse weapon, it is often utilized by VIPs that are in good standing with Borken.

Highly unusual to the denizens of the Persean Sector, such a well equipped cruiser class freighter likely conceals unimaginable riches yet is the bane of pirates and hostile polities alike. Does the fact that such a super-ship is able to be mass produced by Borken hint at an unimaginable industrial machine behind their displays of might?",,,,
FOB_nyogtha,SHIP,"“That wasn’t a freighter at all”, a surviving pirate is quoted, after encountering a Nyogtha for the first time. Constructed in the old universe, this heavy cruiser was designed as a show of force. A massive array of missile launchers making up the bulk of this ship, it is capable of unloading a relentless barrage at any enemies unfortunate enough to end up in its path.",,,,
FOB_polyps,SHIP,"A powerful cruiser, usually reserved for long-serving elite captains within the Borken navy. Equipped with a deadly Greystab cannon and capable of dashing through P-space, it excels at pursuit. As soon as enemy fleets begin retreat, these vessels are said to hunt them down like bloodthirsty piranhas. In regular combat, however, Polyps captains have are said to use near-suicidal tactics, causing some fleet commanders to advise holding them back in reserve for the initial phases of battle.",,,,
FOB_byakhee,SHIP,"""The Byakhee’s hull may appear unsightly at first glance, but you will see its true beauty once she has received her wings""- <Borken Byakhee Mucus-link Operations Guide>

The Byakhee is a rarely seen modular carrier, featuring two flight decks in the main hull and an additional one in each sponson module. To the Borken the concept of carriers is outdated, but in order to adapt to the human style of warfare they developed and marketed two classes of carrier vessels. The Byakhee sacrifices the ability to dive into P-space common to other Borken vessels, instead utilizing a modular hangar system attached to the main hull through a biological mucus substance. The attached modules are capable of projecting temporary energy membranes, the rarely seen Borken version of energy shields.",,,,
FOB_shantak,SHIP,"When the Borken became aware of the threat posed by carriers in the Persean Sector, they designed carriers of their own as escort vessels for VIP customers to put them at ease. Rarely employed by the Foundation in their own fleets, it is clear that this vessel was constructed as a publicity act more than anything.

Like the Byakhee, the Shantak was designed by a more open-minded group of Borken. Some say if the old gods still lived, they would scoff at this behavior.",,,,
FOB_oldgodscholar,SHIP,"A modification of the ApproLight Scholar light cruiser, replacing its signature torpedo tubes with the massive Breath of Cthuga, which requires a massive amount of energy to fire and takes up the entire front of the vessel. Requiring the ship to unfold its front armour to fire, it takes a long time to fire, but the damage is devastating. While employing the same system as the Polyps class, the stronger hull and armor of the Old God Scholar allow it to make better use of the system.

While the ship’s name doesn’t seem to be traditionally Borken, experts have suggested that this might be due to a difference in meaning in their own language.",,,,
FOB_cthylla,SHIP,"A light cruiser at odds with Borken style, its mobility allows it to play with the enemy. Often referred to as the ""Daughter of the Gods"" by the Borken.

Despite the heightened incidence of insanity among the crew, most captains state that the hovering turrets are highly unlikely to catalyze any sacrificial rituals as long as there is an enemy to fight.",,,,
FOB_ammutseba,SHIP,"A massive exploratory vessel constructed by the Foundation of Borken. The massive platform is equipped with highly advanced sensors allowing for unparalleled efficiency at handling salvage and survey tasks. The ship is also covered in a liquid membrane that can stabilize a fleet's drive field if the Ammutseba is equipped with enough flux vents to power it safely. A unique feature of this ship are its massive plier-like protusions that are seemingly equipped with a special kind of tractor ray capable of pulling in all kinds of metals.

The Ammutseba is well-known for its great cost-efficiency in Borken markets and many a captain would be well-advised to purchase one of these ships if they seek to explore the outer reaches of the sector. Fortunately the Ammutseba, unlike most other logistics craft of the Foundation, does not come with a mandatory and expensive ceremonial workshop facility.",,,,
FOB_boss_rast,SHIP,"These ships have not only undergone large-scale modification, but most of them are far beyond the original design specifications. The purpose of this is not only to let them play a specific role that they could not otherwise, but also to draw from the original hull the last drop of usable potential. Only in very rare cases will a ship be so completely transformed and become a so-called ""integrated ship"". These ships with unique performance and higher capabilities are usually added before the name of the ship {Mod, stands for'modification'}. As they have achieved outstanding achievements on the battlefield and gained legendary prestige, they have also become the precious possessions dreamed of by elite pirates, bounty hunters, and industry elites.

This is a battleship named after the famous wandering noble of the Borken Foundation, Luster the Desire. It is said that this warship has five souls, which together contain part of Borkenzu god. This specificity enables it to manipulate time to a certain extent. She was stolen in a very influential galaxy war. Although Luster himself quickly released a large bounty mission, he didn't seem to care about the final ownership of the battleship",,,,
,,,,,,
FOB_shaggai,SHIP,"A fast and durable all-round fighter. The concept of strike craft is considered anachronistic and strange to the Borken in a universe where powerful long-range artillery is so common and popular. Regardless, the Foundation developed this fighter, be it to test their viability for themselves or just to satisfy customer demand for carrier vessels.",,,,

You look at the writhing tentacles looming next to the sheds and think, ""I'd be a fool to go there.",,
goghoor,CUSTOM,"A temporary military base of the foundation. While temporary, its size equals that of more permanent military bases throughout the Sector. Goghoor is more prosperous than the capital. Fundamentally, force - the code of conduct for ensuring safe trade is vividly embodied here. The Borken seem to be more at home in these places than the Foundation’s capital.

fob,FACTION,"The Foundation of Borken originates from an ancient universe, from a different strand of time than ours. Some of your contacts say they are searching for something important in our universe, but the Foundation’s higher-ups will firmly deny that their presence in our universe is of any real significance. What we do know comes from a document recovered from a massive ancient battleship that appears to have been built by the Borken eons ago.

The document is a detailed description of the formation and purpose of the Foundation. However since the contents are extremely complicated and still not fully translated, only a brief summary is available. The “Foundation” is a name used only diplomatically and its true name is Cthulasus Borken. Hailing from a different universe, their people have been living in hyperspace for millennia, their ancestors were defeated in a great war once fought in a higher dimension. Struck a terrible blow, having lost all their colonies, the surviving Borken had banded together in a great fleet that destroyed the galaxies of their old homes and at the great cost of two thirds of their forces opened a rift that would take them to the hyperspace area corresponding to the Persean Sector where they settled to rebuild their civilization.",,,,
