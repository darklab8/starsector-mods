Location: A corner of a galaxy on the edge of Perseus

The people of Borken are not ready to officially appear in this star field, so they don't want to be seen by anyone. Before their ancestral gods collapsed, they left a gift for them, which made it impossible for low-level organic lifeforms to obtain any effective information from them at the physical level, but non-living things such as artificial intelligence were not included.

Due to an accident, the Borken warship was detected by a large number of local artificial intelligence fleets. The Borkens promptly used strong electromagnetic interference to cut off the surrounding communication signals, and decided to eliminate them directly to eliminate future problems.

As for what some Borken engineers said, modifying their program codes would be a little safer, and destruction could only bring new investigations? Please, who knows if these cunning locals will leave a back door like their broadcast station? Rather than worrying about this, it is better to crush them into dust and let the body and the *soul* disappear together.
