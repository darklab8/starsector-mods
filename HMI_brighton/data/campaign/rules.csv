On close inspection, the signals being transmitted are attempting to contact several assets in system, although what their significance is and their precise location is unclear from the fairly basic device. Only rudimentary information can be extracted from the response signals. One asset is being obscured by the corona of a star due to the strong ionic static of solar wind in the return signal. Another is in an asteroid field, according to the pops and clicks of asteroid interference. Yet another is in a Lagrange point of Devon, due to Doppler stretching of the signal.""

AddText ""But what is intriguing is the indication of a location outside of the system, somewhere north and east in relation to Manchester.

$id == stationDerelict4","AddText""Heading in through a particularly large ruined section you find an entry point - a blast door with a somewhat intact terminal. It doesn't take long to power up the local system and open the door. Inside the facility is dead and airless, dust and trash and debris floating like a slick wet fog. It's bothersome moving through the facility, having to continually open and close blast doors as you wade through the junk, but you make steady headway into the station. Every now and then you catch a glimpse  messages scrawled on the wall, floor, or sometimes floor. The messages are sometimes carefully written directions to where a loved one is, sometimes a spiteful scrawl against the lies of 'DomRes', and sometimes more ordered writing directions to exit points or damaged sections. Once you make it through these tunnels you approach the Western Promenade, the only section still relatively intact. The debris is absent here, the space inside having been vented a long time ago. The reason is high above you - the top of the entire structure can be jury rigged to open, but frustratingly only from the inside. The insistent transmission interferes with any sort of remote you could set up to open the door automatically. Anything stored here will be protected from the elements and be guaranteed to still be there when you return - if it is secured well enough. As you explore, you wonder if this time you'll find that blasted transmitter and blow the bloody thing to smithereens - you wouldn't be surprised if half the damage to the outside structure was done to do just that.""",,,

Particularly of interest is a set of schematics and blueprints that can vastly improve the quality of life on a colony. Everything from air filters that can remove toxic gases and convert them into passive energy, to seals that do not degrade under the most vigorous chemical assault, to thin radiation plating that can block just as well as fifty feet of high-end rad shields can be easily constructed from the blueprints using trivially sourced materials. Using these designs and more, colonial exploitation can be made considerably less hazardous for the enterprising colonist.

It takes several hours for the poor bastard stuck with the job to finish the task of plying the rad-fried hardware and hideously outdated software to satisfy your curiosity, but eventually a summary is sent to your console.

The first messages are simple orders to claim high priority systems for a 'South Expanse Company'. Later, the communications change source from the company to 'Domain Resurgent', although whether the company changed names or the organisation co-opted the company's assets is unclear. There are some rudimentary surveying information transfers evaluating possible terraforming possibilities, and then a series of increasingly frantic commands which indicate co-ordinates south-west and travel. However, due to some damage in the station or interference, the commands are incomplete. They either demand 'travel' or they give coordinates  but never in the same message. The final command is a Defence Activation, which caused the station to go into star system lock-down and unleash roaming fleets.
