bastillon_scav,SHIP,"On finding the Bastillion chasis lackluster, the Brighton Federation instead altered the ship to produce a somewhat original construction.

scintilla_scav,SHIP,"Constructing a vessel from Scintilla pieces with integrated crew bays and fighter autofactories still left ample room for additional ordnance and engine efficiency. The reconstruction process also revealed several critical flaws in the structure of the vessel. Thus, this ship relies on its scavenged Remnant shield to tank damage, and combination of weaponry and fighters to strike at the enemy before escaping. If stuck out in the open without its shield, this ship will be scrapped in short order. However, in the hands of an able captain, this ship is an effective combat vessel.

rampart_scav,SHIP,"With ridiculously heavy armour and a huge frame, a remade Rampart hull was considered to be too difficult to use as a dedicated combat ship without either breaking apart from manoeuvering too quickly, or easily being destroyed once in combat. Instead, the large weapon mounts were removed and replaced with fighter bays. With additions from scavanged Gemini and Mora hulls, this ship becomes a monster of a support vessel. Slow and unwieldy, this ship lacks the ability to fight enemies effectively by itself and relies almost exclusively on its fighter contigent for defence.

brilliant_scav,SHIP,"The Brilliant (BRV) is possibly the only genuinely effective Brighton Federation derivative of a Domain or Remnant vessel. This can be attributed more to the fact it is less of a reconstruction and more of a new vessel design built on the foundation of the Brilliant. With heavier armour and a heavier weapons layout, this ship is a fairly threatening vessel on the battlefield.

apogee_scav,SHIP,"Derived from a known blueprint but constructed from assorted Remnant and original construction materials, the Apogee (BRV) is a curious vessel. The Brighton version bears considerable differences with the Apogee on the fundamental level, and yet the functionality remains largely similar between the two classes. When compared with the base Apogee, the Apogee (BRV) has a less stable hull construction and a more irregular subsystem setup, however it packs a considerable missile-focused loadout.

 The Apogee-class vessel is an effective mix of advanced scientific and military technologies, perfect for long-range exploration of hostile space. 

The class features an asymmetric design with a large forward section, usually outfitted with long-range tech scanners. Apogee captains are used to operating alone and tend to be an independent, self-reliant lot. 

The ship can hold its own in one-on-one engagements by smart use of its powerful shield emitter and strong engines. However, its armor rating makes it seem somewhat fragile on paper, and thus it is rarely part of big fleet actions. 

The high construction costs typically mean that only affluent tech mining consortiums can afford an Apogee-class vessel that is fully outfitted for an aggressive exploratory role.",,,
apex_scav,SHIP,"Thee Apex (BRV) largely maintains the central structure of a scavenged Apex, with the rest of the ship being constructed of other, 'safer' parts.  This means that the core four medium synergy mounts remain intact along with the Energy Bolt Coherence technology, enabling close support options with energy weapons or an intense missile strike. Regrettably the maintenance of the Bolt Coherer technology proves lethal to crew working in the central section if interfered with by ship combat, making the usage of this ship a double edged sword.

radiant_scav,SHIP,"An incredibly unusual vessel, the Radiant (BRV) is the largest vessel available to the Brighton Federation derived from a Domain or Remnant vessel. In truth this ship is more a novel assemblage from other components into a Radiant-esque shape, as acquiring actual Radiant components is incredibly difficult. Repeated skirmishes with the AI threat along with existing AI core 'whaling' has yielded a trickle of chassis to play with, which have been filled out with other components to produce this ship.

nova_scav,SHIP,"An uncommon vessel, the Nova (BRV) is a ramshackle battlecruiser with more gun than sense. Reconstructed from Nova parts with some core systems replaced with Orion Drives scavenged from pirate-modified Ventures, this ship has most of its reinforcement put into withstanding repeated sharp accelerations. Piloting this vessel is incredibly stressful for crew and officer alike, however the large amount of ordinance that can be installed, the flux pool to use it, and the mobility to exploit it ensures that it still sees limited usage in Brighton Federation Fleets.

odyssey_scav,SHIP,"An Odyssey class vessel constructed from assorted Remnant and spatial detritus, the Odyssey (BRV) is a very different ship from the original. Possessing greater tactical flexibility and superior mobility, the Brighton-analogue of the Odyssey has the potential to be a powerful battlecruiser. However, there are key differences that undermine the power the vessel as a result of its construction, making the weapon and engine systems unreliable under heavy combat conditions.

The asymmetric, spheroid design belies the power of this battlecruiser. The base hull presents a tactical setup that favors energy weapons and mobility. Carrier capabilities further augment its tactical options. ",,,

The Bastillon was a hopeful project of Huan-Gogel to up-size its popular ""Defender""-class specialized point-defense war drone. It is bigger, tougher, more heavily armed - and rather more lucrative per-unit to the HGA bottom-line.",,,

The Berserker is a considerably up-sized, up-armed, and up-armoured cousin of the Warden-class for use against heavier opposition. As an automated drone the Berserker's combat algorithms make little consideration for its own survival, instead pursuing and attacking its target relentlessly until either it or the target is destroyed.",,,

Exactly what this organisation is or where it comes from in unclear, however it appears that a large part of its military power was derived from altered versions of automated defense systems, bearing considerably greater combat power than expected of a Domain war-drone.

A rather logical conclusion, the Bracket is an up-armoured version of the ""Bastillon"" war drone. Bigger, meaner and very heavily armed, this vessel was arguably less lucrative than its smaller cousin - after all, it had a nasty tendancy to not die, and thus not need replacement by clients.",,,

The Embrasure is a rarely seen utility vessel of the automated Exploratorium fleet. This platform acts as a resource gathering point, using small Sifter drones to grab raw materials and scavenged parts back to the Embrasure, before taking it back to primary storage and construction facilities. Normally these vessel remain inactive outside of standard function, however certain protocols can be activated which can bring these ships to bear to bulk out defense fleets in times of exceptional need.",,,

The Sapper is a rarely seen utility vessel of the automated Exploratorium fleet. This ship is primarily focused on mining, with an eye towards breaking up asteroids and terrestial deposits for later acquisition by Embrasure class craft.

This one appears to have cut considerable corners in it's production to make it more easily massed.

 The Hornworks class was a design that uses parts from the larger Rampart and Berserker classes. The craft was used to equip smaller autonomous fleets with heavier ordinance, with the intention to bring heavier firepower without having to make an entirely new design, and to efficiently use resources without having to waste them on a larger ship. For the most part the Hornworks executes its function very efficiently, if only somewhat adequately.",,,

Anomaly 12-4C, also known as the Outworks, is something of an oddity that can occassionally coalesce as a consequence of Rampart and Berserker hulls being cannibalised and reassembled by autonomous construction units. The ship itself is simply a commonly observed amalgamation of the modular parts of both hulls being put together into a functional unit. During the Domain's heydey protocols often caught these ships mid construction, causing them to be disassembled and reconstructed properly. However, after many cycles alone on the frontier, autonomous systems can become corrupted, and these ships can emerge in Domain wardrone hangars - and despite their anomalous origins, due to the robustness of the modular construction of Huan-Gogel, these ships are still incredibly dangerous.",,,

Exactly what this organisation is or where it comes from in unclear, however it appears that a large part of its military power was derived from altered versions of automated defense systems, bearing considerably greater combat power than expected of a Domain war-drone. 

Little more than an artillery platform with engines, the Rampart was attached to drone units to provide the heavy firepower necessary to meet cruiser and capital class hulls in the line of combat or to crack armoured orbital fortresses. In either role, heavy losses were anticipated, so the Rampart was designed with highly modular components which allowed badly damaged hulls to be rapidly cannibalized to repair lightly damaged hulls up to combat capacity without the need for shipyard facilities.",,,
domres_hmi_obj_440,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Traditionally only small and relatively light craft were employed by frontier garrisons, using large numerical mass to grind down resistance. However, there were rumours that advanced automated warship designs were created and quietly tested by Huan-Gogel on the frontier, for a possible future when the ban on automated drones was rescinded. Since the collapse these designs occassionally appear in Exploratorium defences, either as an existing prototype or a design selected from a database via glitch. Incredibly rare, these ships are a distinct cut above the standard Exploratorium war drone - and these particular vessels bearing the colours of the Domain Resurgent are particularly dangerous.

The Object 440 was designed to observe if, using existing Exploratorium autofactory infrastructure, a capital grade Expansion Era shield generator could be produced on an autonomous drone. While the answer to this question was affirmative, the produced hull ended up being dedicated almost solely to the shield generator, with very little left aside for actual aggressive interactions with the enemy. Nevertheless, the vessel can block a staggering amount of punishment against its shield, providing ample support for other craft.",,,

Designed to be created from existing Exploratorium autfactories with no alteration to existing infrastructure, the Object 361 is a flexible craft with heavy ballistic armament supported by ample missile mounts. Surprisingly quick for its size and mass, this aggressive ship can perform close support or assault roles admirably. While the forward facing firepower is considerable, the mounts dedicated for point defense are awkward, and no mounts cover the engines. Nevertheless, this craft is still a considerable danger to an unsuspecting scavenger.",,,

Consequently the design should have been deleted from the archives, and yet nevertheless here it is.

Instead of being developed for tactical strikes against the enemy, this vessel is designed for a more straightforward assault against formations. With more resilient weapons and engines, this ship can remain combat effective even after taking crippling damage. In almost every other regard, this vessel is identical underneath the added armour to the base Eagle.",,,

brighton,FACTION,"The Brighton Federation is a rather effervescent polity based on a semi-organised republic of refugees. Originally formed by a small number of nomadic refugees uniting in the face of raider aggression, the Federation has expanded as the principal 'safe' gateway from the outer systems to the Core Worlds. While dedicated to humanitarian efforts, the Federation is often under strain from protecting and processing large numbers of refugees in the face of pirate and pather aggression. When combined with its relative irrelevance to Core World politics and weak industrial base, the Brighton Federation often struggles to make a difference in these trying times. Largely due to its very weak industrial base, the Federation  has turned to scavanging Domain-Era Derelicts and Remnant ships to remain competitive with the pirate raiders, something which has become a trademark of the Federation's stubborn pluckiness.",,,

This one is a much older model, the emitted signal weak from age.",,"On approach your comms is spammed by an insistent transmission. This is not by design - it appears that the transmitter, in order to convey it's message to any vessel that approached, transmits on all frequencies. Not just communication frequencies - ALL frequencies. Including, frustratingly enough, intership communication signals. The signal can be reduced, but the tinny sound continues to squawk through every single communication you make:

""Welcome traveller to Manchester, home of the Domain Resurgent! We are the last remnant of the Domain after the Calamitous Closure of the Gates. On seeing the calamity, the Wise Administrators of Manchester turned their sights to restoring the Domain, sending out Colony Protection Fleets, and setting out to terraform the sector. With the luscious farms of Exeter and the mighty forges of Devon, your every want and desire will be quenched, and soon the Domain will once again bring joy and prosperity to the Sector! Already our expeditions are selecting your future homes, the autonomous drones restructuring the imperfect worlds into lands of milk and honey! All are welcome and safe in the Domain Resurgent, the Last Remnant of Humanity's Domain!""",
