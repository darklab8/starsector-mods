ABOUT

This mod changes how the player's max fleet size is determined: instead of ship count, total DP (not including
mothballed ships) is counted instead.  Going over the fleet DP limit will incur burn speed and supply use
penalties, similar to vanilla.

CONFIGURATION

Mod settings are available in data\config\settings.json.

DISABLING MID-GAME

To disable this mod and return to vanilla fleet tracking, DO NOT disable this mod in the mod manager.  Instead:

1. Open this mod's settings.json file and change "useFleetSizeByDPMod" to false.
2. In the same file, comment out "showMaxShipsWidgetAtShips" and "maxShipsInFleet".
3. With this mod enabled, load game as normal.
