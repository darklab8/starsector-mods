	### ~Notes~ ###
	
	# While the "enable_TechDuinnIsInSystem" config is set to "true" by default, Tech Duinn was designed to be placed in Hyperspace;
	# as such there may be some unforseen quirks I have not yet found with placing it in a system. 
	# That said, doing so should be safe, and may improve your FPS if you find it causes it to drop in Hyperspace when you are nearby
	# the station.
