LTA_Epattcudi,SHIP,"The ship modification on record as the “Epattcud I” is less a functional ship and more a mess of loosely welded and oversized armor plates, sheet metal and flux coils, rigged to a set of barely burn-capable engine parts from a variety of ships.
Its reasonably competent flux systems barely accommodate its bulky frame and weapons mounts, though it has been rigged to support what amounts to a large ballistic turret.

First found floating above the Hegemony base of Ancyra, its crew out-of-supplies and fuel, the small hegemony patrol fleet that uncovered the ship decided to classify this strange ship design ethos as “Epattcud”, in an effort to make it easier for them to identify amid the rather immense variety and specification differences in off-blueprint or part-autofactoried ships. Though rumour states that in fact the name originated as a joke, aimed at the dubiously viable construction of the ship in question. The name has quickly caught on, and is now used to classify a large number of off-book ship designs and styles of mostly unknown or unorthodox origins.

Epattcud is a name given to a variety of often pirate-constructed designs derived entirely or predominantly of scrap parts and materials.  

Due to the many issues with haphazardly slapping scrap plating and cheap flux cores onto even cheaper chassis, crew on ships like these are often required to wear atmosphere-sealed suits when venturing outside of their quarters and the bridge, as aside from these two sections of the ship, many areas are not fully flushed with atmosphere, and some are even left with blatant holes leading to outer space. 

These ships vary in almost every way, and can pose a threat, or a weak link in their fleet, depending on their loadout and hull specifications.

Some more adventurous pirate lords invest in the development of semi-intelligently-planned part-autofactory-built Epattcud designs, the result of which are far more effective and dangerous ships, which often wreak havoc on underprepared fleets. This method even proves cost effective, as it routes most of the monetary costs of requisitioning large amounts of time from one of the few pirate-owned autofactories.",,,

In a future report, it was noted that they often possess a number of distributed Shepherd drone autofactories, covered by thick hull and a small weapons complement.
It was also discovered that several parts for these style of ship, when recovered, appeared to show evidence of autoforged parts and a colloquial blueprint, keeping all designs far more alike in execution than any seen prior.

“Epattcud VI” is the designation assigned to the warship design of unknown origins that covered the pirate assault of Arcadia; little is known of its specifications, though it is thought to be made of mostly nanoforged or autofactory-constructed parts, assembled in two different sections, then joined together to form a full capital ship. The shadow it cast over the station is still etched into the minds of those who live there, and the destruction of the patrol fleets that tried to protect the docking ports has become a story often told in station bars on the fringe.

Monstrously large, these vessels are a pirate symbol of power, boasting the most valuable parts of the most expensive ships the pirates have been able to gut out and reform. When out of fuel, such ships are large enough to become a temporary pirate base until refueling endevours are undertaken, and their tactical prowess is only marginally sullied by absence of competent engine defense systems. Their frontal array is almost always spoken of as being bolstered by a number of ripped-out Onslaught TPC batteries, and reports of crew being blown out of maintenance decks by unexpected static mines are prevalent.

Sometimes rogue Tri-Tachyon engineers and blueprinters band together in the name of rebellion. Sometimes that results in failed prototypes and abandoned ideas. Sometimes that results in station raids by Tri-Tach delegates, resulting in dozens of deaths and arrests.

Despite this, it shares in the usual oversights of off-market engineering, boasting such incredible unreliability on the battlefield that the engineers designing the vessel saw fit to implement an automated repair unit to offset the ridiculous task of maintaining it. 

These designs have been known to be extremely dangerous, but as so few are seen many are unaware of the risks that come with hunting down captains of these vessels, with many central-core dwelling officers and captains believing the designs little more than rumour, likely spread in an effort to misinform Hegemony officials about the combat strengths of various freedom-fighter movements attempting to threaten their annexes of previously-independent worlds.

It comes with an internally-linked missile autoloader, and is often praised for its functionality in long combat engagements, though equally its awful tracking AI has earned infamy among experienced fleet commanders for occasionally overcompensating while struggling to hit enemy ships head-on, and smattering their subordinates’ ships with molten metal and plasma.

The Independent mercenary group that created the Nixie Cannon was repeatedly re-commissioned by the Hegemony in an attempt to spur-on development of additional weapons of a similar design ethos, though it took a while for the group to show marketable results. Most weapons created under the same parameters were simply too expensive or too large to fit in standard mounts. The Nixus was the first functional post-collapse design from the group, and despite its quirks, the Hegemony saw potential in the multipurpose nature of the weapon, and adopted it for use in their military fleets for use on their backline support ships.

The design is often retrieved intact after combat with Hegemony mining and trade fleets by Pirate raiding forces, and has found some additional adoption within the wider sector through black market sales, despite the best efforts of several influential Hegemony leaders.",,,
LTA_nixiemissilemedium,WEAPON,"The Large Nixus is a concerted attempt to capitalise on the Nixus’s ability to spray an area with ordnance, opting to increase the number of projectile outlets dramatically, though the added weight makes the missile slower and less maneuverable.

It comes with an internally-linked missile autoloader, and is often praised for its functionality in long combat engagements, though equally its awful tracking AI has earned infamy among experienced fleet commanders for occasionally overcompensating while struggling to hit enemy ships head-on, and smattering their subordinates’ ships with molten metal and plasma, though notably less so than the small Nixus launcher, as the huge spray it offers has been known to disable and damage mountings and armour on a muiltitude of targets at once, while rendering fighter squadrons drifting aimlessly through space.

Once the smaller Nixus Launcher became a staple of the Hegemony backline, they proceeded to commission development of a version that could make use of larger mounting points on ships. The design team from the mercenary company then somewhat unexpectedly pitched a drastically upscaled Nixus, instead of the far easier to engineer standard two-slot missile autoloader the Hegemony had been expecting. In the end the design was funded and after several highly successful trial combat tests the Hegemony funded full production of the weapon, cementing the Mercenary group as a military asset, even if a politically independent one.",,,
LTA_nixiemissilelarge,WEAPON,"The Nyx Drone Launcher is a large autoloader with a distending platform and rail that is designed to launch large low-performance drones loaded with missiles and ammo into combat.

The drones suffer from an underwhelming shipfighting AI, caused mostly by the exhaustively tiny low-overhead binary computer that can barely run the systems on-board, but they manage to circle targets and avoid collisions while firing their plethora of small weaponry. 

The Nyx Drone Launcher was not intended to be mass-produced, it started as concept art drawn by a member of the mercenary company’s design team that was dying of a near-terminal illness, and in the months before they were expected to become immobile, a crowd-funding campaign successfully managed to pay for life-saving intervention. In their proceeding recovery, the rest of the design team created a series of blueprints for the complex autoloader and drone, and eventually self-funded the production of the launcher. The Hegemony was encouraged to adopt the design as a showpiece by a now-public audience, and in an attempt to gain public trust, they adopted the design small-scale into the backline of some of their system defense-fleets. Somewhat surprisingly the design proved useful in assisting with otherwise high-fighter-loss engagements, and the design stuck.",,,
LTA_hex,WEAPON,"The HE-X Heavy Cannon is a somewhat advanced late Domain-era Missile Cannon, combining the perceived strengths of heavy shell cannons with light guidance and a secondary explosive payload, though at the cost of any ability to reliably hit small targets.

While it was a co-opted project of the Domain and the United Earth Directorate, the HE-X was meerly one of many weapons developed in shared manufacturers with split profits to ensure ongoing relations did not sour, and as such was designed more for best-in-class performance than overall usability. The turret’s notoriously awful turning speed and ludicrous fitting requirements meant it rarely saw battle, but it still gained favour among military companies for its high-output potential for its flux requirements and multi-mount compatibility, which let it surprise unwary opponents.

Though not the first of its kind to enter the Domain military markets, the HE-X was prized for its versatility against a variety of targets. The weapon is however a nightmare to find mounting specifications for and often requires a great deal of engineering expertise to feed into traditional ammo-lines and flux buffers correctly, but sports best-in-class efficiency and potential damage per payload thanks to some incredibly compact explosives backed by a secondary engine-fed plasma payload. The complex missile microfactory manufacturing removes any possibility for effective engine alterations, and as such the weapon is considered more of a cannon than a missile launcher.
