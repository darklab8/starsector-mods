    // implementation and wrote these comments as a form of guide.                         //
    // As far as I am aware I have implemented the code in the simplest possible format,   //
    // but I am inexperienced comparative to many of the other members of the community.   //

    // any feedback or I wrote something not clearly/concisely enough please feel free to  //
    // contact me on the forums or on Discord in the unofficial Starsector Discord server. // 
    
    // Bananao provided some sample code I used for reference when making this.            //

    // 2 Ship Modules (to control using the weapons) (*These are our arms that we're going to wiggle around and aim at enemies*)    //
    // A java file laid out like the following, located in a scripts capable folder, (You will likely want to "compile" this later. //
    // If you're new to compiling, ask another modder about "IDE" programs and compiling with them):                                //

// - Weapon slot ids on the ship you're doing this on are recommended to be unique (for the     //
//   module and weapon slots we're using in this file) due to potential crashes and issues      //
//   with other vessels.                                                                        //
// - Crashes/Bugs caused by this script should be traceable in the starsector log, located in   //
//   "Starsector\starsector-core". Look out for file directories and recognisable IDs.          //
