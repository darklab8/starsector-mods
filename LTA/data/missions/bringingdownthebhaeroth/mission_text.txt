Tri-Tachyon Picket Fleet pursuing from Skathi ~

It was so easy. 

The Hegemony fast picket had gotten cocky, and flown too close to Skathi to escape our burn. We took chase and were gaining on their position, but they diverted course into an asteroid belt to avoid our sensors. Rather than wait them out, we chose to pursue them for the easy credits from the ship hit-list. What a god-awful idea that was.

It was waiting for us there, among the dust and rock. We didn't see it at first, our fleet's sensors were obscured by the exhaust plumes of their ships and it was just too big for us to process what we were seeing... At least until we got close enough for them to initiate an emergency burn.

Attempting a retreat now would be hopeless, the number of long range fighters on that 'thing' would likely take most of us before we even left this damned field.

Picket-lead has ordered us in with the Hegemony, I pray I write another entry. V-C Heris signing off.
