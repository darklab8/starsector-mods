The fleet holds in space just out of combat range, seemingly trying to intimidate you into leaving them alone. Your comms officer informs you they have partially decrypted some transmissions currently being broadcasted back and forth between the lurking fleet and the ship, and it becomes apparent that the fleet are trying to force the crew of the vessel to give up stolen goods from the 'Tech Duinn high delegates', though what or who this group are is a loss to you.

Eventually, finding themselves at a standstill, your comms officer informs you that they appear to have agreed to leave their differences aside and focus on the threat at hand; you.",,
