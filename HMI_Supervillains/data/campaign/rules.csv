Here and there animalistic enforcers brawl and yell and piss and shit and do all sorts of abominable things between casual conversations and insidious insults against Merchants. Butchered body parts are argued over and sold, and doe-eyed slaves fit for butchering look out at you from cages, begging and pleading for purchase or already consigned to their terrifying fate. You resolve to complete your business here quickly.""",,,

A perfectly terraformed location, a high prize for the major factions, a possible Luddic Church pilgramage site - and entirely inaccessible. Even now, being this close risks being entrapped in a cockatrice stare of hidden defensive batteries, stealth mines and hyperspace triggers - and that's not even taking into account whatever hostile fleets are hidden nearby awaiting any attempt to go into low orbit.

To get any nearer would be incredibly dangerous. However, if the local Fang and Draco presences are both removed, and suitable time has passed, then disassembly of the defenses would receive a lot less of an intense reaction.",,
