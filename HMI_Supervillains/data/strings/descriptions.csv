# FRIGATES FRIGATES FRIGATES,,,,,
,,,,,
hmi_fang_kite,SHIP,"Given a slap of paint by the Fang Society, this little civilian shuttle is used as a small torpedo boat to nimbly strike at stricken targets.

A familiar civilian design, the ""Kite""-class aeroshuttle is the day-to-day reminder of Fabrique Orbitale's reputation for aeronautical engineering- a valuable specialty even in the age of space travel. This compact space/aircraft is streamlined for efficient atmospheric flight and boasts a grid of cleverly distributed short-burst manoeuvring thrusters coordinated by a delta-level AI subsystem to ensure smooth landings (a point driven home by Fabrique marketing by way of amusing ad-holos featuring a well-dressed couple and an overfull wine glass). The Kite has powerful engines for a civilian ship of its size, though zero-G manoeuvrability leaves something to be desired when the special subsystem is not engaged.

In the dangerous cycles post-Collapse, the Kite has been outfitted with a defense turret in place of the executive-class viewing dome and the two auxiliary jet-pods are replaced with missile systems (which do not need to draw on the limited powerplant). It won't stand up in a fair fight, but the Kite can be given unexpectedly sharp teeth and use its speed to escape from raiders. Luddic Path radicals have even been known to use modified Kite to deliver strike weapons against helpless freighters, followed by engaging the manoeuvring subsystem to make a swift exit to avoid the wrath of their victim's escort.",,,
hmi_fang_cerberus,SHIP,"A somewhat simple modification by the Fang Society, this Cerberus has been improved with an accelerated ammunition feeder system at the cost of it's burn drive. The result is a somewhat vulnerable little frigate with a truly withering level of firepower.

The Cerberus is prized for providing a cost-effective balance between cargo capacity and enough combat power for its size to discourage casual piracy with the happy result of lowered insurance rates compared to standard Domain-era civilian grade freighters. The Cerberus is now widely considered to be a wise choice for independent traders in the Sector. 

In times past, before the fall of the gate system when Domain authority reigned, combat-enabled freighters like the Cerberus found only niche use on the edges of the rare warzone or in especially uncivilized hinterlands of the galaxy where Domain Armada patrols were stretched thinly. The crew combat training, weapon maintenance, and mass/thrust ratio loss caused by heavier armour were viewed as causing unnecessary cost overhead. But this is a new age filled with both danger and profitable opportunities; the abilities of the Cerberus have given the hull a new life in the trade lanes.",,,
hmi_fang_shepherd,SHIP,"Modified by the  Fang Society, this ship has the Borer Drone Autofactory stripped out to accommodate a Talon autofactory. Further, the small mounts have been altered for missile capability, enabling the vessel to also function as an effective if light missile and interceptor boat. The changes however make the ship require a larger crew than is physically possible to fit on the ship, causing some logistical issues in accommodating crew on other ships.

The Ko Combine r450 ""Shepherd"" sets the standard for civilian drone tenders with unmatched reliability, low cost, and internal volume given to crew comfort. A wildly popular combat modification package has been assembled by various survivalist and pirate groups, the ""HK"" mod, which consists of specifications to up-armour the hull for combat and supercharge factory-spec systems for greater burst speed and weapon function. Even modified, the Shepherd is fragile, so as in civilian life it relies on a swarm of “Borer” utility drones to do its work.

 The ""Borer"" is built on a hardy, manoeuvrable semi-autonomous drone chassis with shielding suitable for hazardous operations in which high radiation or physical impacts may be expected. Commonly used in mining applications, they have also found use in salvage, ordnance disposal, and even fission meltdown clean-up. The HK mod package gives specifications for altering the primary cutting beam's focus and patches the rudimentary AI with crude tactical algorithms pirated from obsolete Domain Colonial Garrison drone software. Appendices of the mod package recommend caution when employing HK-modified drones in non-combat situations.",,,
hmi_fang_vanguard,SHIP,"This Fang Society overhaul of the venerable Vanguard design integrates a down-sized Orion Device into the hull. Further, the Damper Field has been modified by more devious members of the Fang Society to enable the ship to fire while the field is active. The result is a very mobile, thickly armoured ship capable of surviving surprising amounts of damage.

This design is old enough to be contemporary with early models of the Onslaught battleship, though unlike that illustrious pillar of the Domain Navy the Vanguard was retired from service long before the collapse of the Gate network. In the post-Collapse chaos it was a chance discovery by an enterprising arms dealer that saw relatively complete schematics of the Vanguard-class heavy frigate lifted from an overlooked museum exhibit. The atavistic and aggressive design opens an unexpected niche for the Vanguard in modern fleets - with the added advantage that all essential components have been declassified for ages, and are of simple make; even repair of catastrophic damage is relatively straightforward.",,,
hmi_fang_charlie,SHIP,"An unusual vessel, the Charlie (also known as the Muntz) is a Fang Society phase vessel. Utilising an improved version of the Gremlin cloak called the Ring cloak, this ship can temporarily accelerate time on emerging from phase space. Combined with an aggressive arms package, thick armour and an Orion Device movement system, this ship can rapidly approach and demolish targets with overwhelming power. However, the Ring Cloak requires a cooldown before it can plunge the ship back into phase, leaving it vulnerable if the initial strike fails.

While the Gremlin's phase coil set up is well known for being a truly horrific set up due to the psychological impact it has on crews, the Ring Cloak system is a altogether kinder derivative of the phase coil. While the Ring Cloak requires regular flux redistribution in the coils every time the ship emerges from p-space, the thick structure and sheer bulk of the redistribution system shields the crew from anomalous phase variations while also allowing the ship to temporarily 'bleed' with phase space, allowing temporal acceleration on emergence. This of course makes the vessel more vulnerable when existing p-space, which is the key drawback to the cloak.",,,
,,,,,
hmi_draco_brawler,SHIP,"A Brawler modified by the Draco Group, this ship has an Aegis EMP Arc System and bears the hallmarks of Tri-Tachyon modification. The result is a fast, energy-based gunship, able to move nimbly into combat, while also protecting its vulnerable rear with the Aegis EMP Arc system, vastly improving its survivability.

Typically deployed to beef up system police forces and port authority security, the Brawler-class frigate is a robust design which trades mobility (and comfort) for impressive firepower, armor, and a destroyer-grade power generator.",,,
hmi_draco_vigilance,SHIP,"Modified by the Draco Group, this Vigilance has an Aegis EMP Arc System which emits protective EMP arcs depending the ship's flux level. It has also been altered using the Tri-Tachyon modification package, replacing ballistic capability and the missile reloading system with High Energy Focus. The result is an effective strike vessel or a dangerous support ship.

An excellent harasser and support frigate, the Vigilance-class has oversized (for its class) energy and missile mounts. While it shines in a fleet setting, it can be easily overwhelmed by large numbers of smaller threats.",,,
hmi_draco_centurion,SHIP,"Altered by the Draco Group, this ship has the Damper Field replaced with an EMP emitter, and a Tri-Tachyon modification package, replacing ballistic capability with energy-based weapon mounts. The result is an energy focused defensive vessel, if slightly sluggish.

A solid heavy combat frigate, the Centurion can be counted upon to fill and hold gaps in the line of battle, as per the Domain-era doctrine practiced by the successor-state of the XIV Battlegroup.

The Centurion is valued for its versatility due to an abundance of hybrid weapon slots and an integrated Damper Field that allows it to shrug off the fearsome firepower it is sure to face in combat.",,,
hmi_draco_remora,SHIP,"A Draco modification of the Remora, the drone bay is replaced with a forward-facing energy mount and militarized systems. Losing all of its scavenging abilities, this ship acts to provide additional support in engagements either as a nimble (if fragile) strike craft, or a long range support vessel.",,,
hmi_draco_appeasement,SHIP,"An old Tri-Tachyon prototype of the Afflictor borne from the engineering standpoint that the Phase Cloak was unfeasible, this vessel has been adopted by the Draco Group as a warship. This ship bears a Clarent Bridgehead Device system, which teleports the ship and washes the enemy with higher-dimensional EMP arcing. Combined with it's upsized armament and deep flux capacity, this ship works as an excellent formation breaker - assuming the shields hold.

Phase Cloaking is an advanced piece of technology, and some individuals within Tri-Tachyon perceived that its widespread implementation would be impossible. This was due to the expense of the drive, the long-term effects of sustained p-space exposure on crew and officers, and the reliability of the cloak itself. Consequently a limited run of 'phaseless' prototypes were produced, however these ships repeatedly ran into problems with their extraneous systems. 

In the case of the Appeasement, the Entropy Amplifier was difficult to charge up, as a large part of the system required the time dilation effect provided by the phase cloak. The logistically simpler Entropy Accelerator system was the compromise, which provided similar effects to the Accelerator while not requiring the phase cloak system.  After review, it was determined that the ship itself lacked the punch of the normal Afflictor for rather nebulous benefits, and officially decommissioned and converted into Afflictors.

The Draco Group however have removed the system, and filled the ample infrastructure with an overtuned Aegis system interlinked with a phase leap system. When the 'Clarent Bridgehead' system activated, the Aegis vents its arcing as the ship transits. The result is a 'sling-shot' effect, where the ship travels forward in partial p-space while storing up EMP discharge, and on emergence the system releases a cloud of accumulated EMP energy as a storm of EMP arcs. The process is incredibly flux intensive, but it works as a very effective formation breaker.",,,

#DESTROYERS DESTROYERS DESTROYERS,,,,,
,,,,,
hmi_fang_caballoloco,SHIP,"A crazed Mule hackjob produced by the Fang Society, the Caballo Loco replaces the front of the ship with various gun mountings, and replaces the back with a miniature Orion Device. This quick and heavy ship is truly frightening in close quarters, holding a horrifying amount of forward firepower that can be brought to bear with frightening speed. However, the underlying chassis is still a Mule with all the fragilities that entails, making it a truly terrifying horse to ride.",,,
hmi_fang_burro,SHIP,"A ship of unknown providence, the Burro is a brutal ship with a terrifying armament, protected by an updated Damper Field, and propelled by a miniature Orion Device. Despite the potency of such a package, the design definitely shows its age if caught at long range.

The Burro is clearly a design with significant similarities to the Vanguard, however the underlying chassis in some cases has more in common with a Manticore or an Enforcer. Considering the yawning span of time between when all of these ships were designed, it is not clear where the Burro came from. Analysts have hypothesized that the design may have been an attempt to produce a competitor to the Enforcer, or an effort by a fringe admiral to explore a shieldless battlegroup, but without more information it is a complete mystery where this hull came from - and how it got into the hands of the Fang Society.",,,
hmi_fang_mule,SHIP,"Bearing a surprising lack of outward modifications by the Fang Society, this vessel bears little more than a fancy paintjob to differentiate it from other Mule chassis. Internal alterations involve a worrying amount of what appears to be prison cells.

 The Mule is a rugged and reliable combat-capable freighter which built its reputation on the sparsely-patrolled frontiers of the Domain. Post-collapse, the Mule's appeal only grown through the cycles of chaos which wrack the Persean Sector and elevate the importance of strong armor and powerful weapons to otherwise thrifty traders, scavengers, and prospectors.

 The original design officially designated its medium turret mount as a 'gimbaled mining utility attachment point', and even Domain operators from time past knew to read between the lines: without an escort, the Mule-class packs enough of a kick to make pirates think twice before attacking. Of course this also means that the Mule has become the ideal vehicle for a down-on-its-luck or merely opportunistic civilian crew to themselves turn pirate.",,,
hmi_fang_condor,SHIP,"Modified by the craftier individuals of the Fang Society, this ship has been modified with enhanced ballistic firepower and integrated ballistic rangefinders to provide close support in combat as well as lending fighter cover. The modifications however have drastically inhibited the structural integrity of the vessel, making it far more likely to be destroyed if caught out. Further, while the ship can be flexibly outfit, the limited hull chassis ensures that this ship works only as a carrier or a gunship.

The Condor-class sees heavy service in the Sector as this carrier-converted freighter is, for many independent polities, the easiest way to procure fighter capability for their organization. Even with limited flight deck space, the Condor gets the job done, relying on its tough armor, excellent bulkhead strength, and a respectable (for a light carrier) weapons package.

This light carrier design is derived from Tarsus-class freighters modified by desperate scavengers and pirates. The conversion process was once an involved and complex affair requiring space dock facilities, but nowadays any hull-capable forge that will accept a stock Tarsus spec will, with the addition of a custom modchip, get you something just as good. 

Some in the Sector argue that even the Domain, with all their technological know-how, relied on similar conversions to make more efficient use of a merchant fleet during times of escalated hostilities on the voluminous galactic frontier. Others point out that it is unclear how ubiquitous this approach was - there could have been fleets of Condors roaming Domain space, but there is scarce hard evidence one way or the other. Such data was all lost in the Collapse.",,,
hmi_fang_wobbie,SHIP,"The Wobbie is a Fang Society destroyer using the Ring Cloak system and integrating an Orion Device. Apparently the design principal behind the ship was  to put as much armour and armament around the circular phase drive and Orion Device as possible, while maintaining the ships ability to remain in p-space. The result is a heavy thug of a ship that can overwhelm the enemy and weather the long Ring Cloak flush before being able to phase again. However, the high degree of overtuning required to make the Wobbie function correctly has negative consequences in prolonged combat.

While the Gremlin's phase coil set up is well known for being a truly horrific set up due to the psychological impact it has on crews, the Ring Cloak system is a altogether kinder derivative of the phase coil. While the Ring Cloak requires regular flux redistribution in the coils every time the ship emerges from p-space, the thick structure and sheer bulk of the redistribution system shields the crew from anomalous phase variations while also allowing the ship to temporarily 'bleed' with phase space, allowing temporal acceleration on emergence. This of course makes the vessel more vulnerable when existing p-space, which is the key drawback to the cloak.",,,
,,,,,
hmi_draco_hammerhead,SHIP,"Modified by the Draco Group, this prototype Tri-Tachyon Hammerhead has an Aegis EMP Arc System which emits protective EMP arcs depending the ship's flux level. Further, the plasma burn system has been stripped out, and replaced with a high energy focus system, to produce a shockingly effective strike vessel.

The Hammerhead is a well-respected vessel due to its versatile ballistic loadout and good staying power. Naturally the Tri-Tachyon Corporation would investigate a high-tech refit of the vessel, however modification of the vessel often ran into issues. Sometimes the project itself had its funding redirected to other sources, other times the project itself was just a front for embezzlement, and yet other times the modifications did not meet the design goals set out by the Executive Design Committee. The Hammerhead (TT) only passed the prototype stage when a Mayasuran with a deep affinity and love of the Hammerhead chassis came up with a fairly workable design independently of Tri-Tachyon attempts. She was quickly recruited, and she now heads the Hammerhead (TT) development project, of which this is a prototype model. The Draco Group's model, instead of focusing on mobility, integrates a high energy focus system to produce a sluggish if dangerously powerful energy-based gunship.",,,
hmi_draco_drover,SHIP,"This Tri-Tachyon prototype of the Drover has an Aegis EMP Arc System installed, which emits protective EMP arcs depending the ship's flux level. This drastically improves the Drover's survivability when attacked by missiles and fighters, increasing the deployment time this ship possesses.

The Drover has always been an effective light carrier, predominantly used in Persean League fleets. It was only natural for the Tri-Tachyon to experiment with using such ships in their doctrine, but time and time again the crew losses from fighters and the lack of mobility hampered their utility in the Hit and Run doctrine of the company. Several enterprising ship designers played around with a Tri-Tachyon equivalent, utilising a High Tech packages to increase the ship's mobility, however all attempts were unsuccessful. After multiple redesigns and repeated failures, the ship class was completely abandoned. Not even limited runs of this ship were produced, and the design was thought deleted. It is rather curious, then, that this lost, failed design somehow ended up in the hands of the Draco Group as an effective light carrier, replacing the flare system (superfluous in the face of the Aegis EMP emitter) with a targeting array, and focusing on enhancing the fighter strike capability of the Draco fleets.",,,
hmi_draco_sunder,SHIP,"Modified by the Draco Group, this Sunder modification has an Aegis EMP Arc System which emits protective EMP arcs depending the ship's flux level at the cost of the rear point defense energy mount. Widely considered to be a good trade, producing an effective if slightly more logistically intensive Sunder analogue.

A technologically advanced yet fragile destroyer from the late Domain era designed to provide additional firepower in fleet actions carried out by the stretched Domain Navy rather than serve on independent patrols. It has powerful shield emitters and energy weapons but is vulnerable to strike craft and flanking assault frigates.",,,
hmi_draco_hippocampus,SHIP,"Modified by the Draco Group, this ship has an Aegis EMP Arc System which emits protective EMP arcs depending the ship's flux level. Further, the surveying sensor suite has been modified to drastically enhance the range of the attached energy mounts. This alteration has resulted in the loss of one of its fighter decks, reducing its fighter strike potential - but this sacrifice is more than enough to enhance the lethality of the Draco Group's Hippocampus.

Taking note of the rapidly changing situation in the Persean Sector, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation investigated an alternative to the Venture that could deal with the new chaotic realities they found themselves in. The culmination of this research was the Hippocampus, a modification of the Gemini with improved flux systems, a conversion to a more flexible weapons and flight deck loadout, and the inclusion of a very sophisticated range of photometric scanners, deep-terrain sensors and atmosphere characterisation equipment that drastically reduces the workload cost required to carry out a survey. The cost of the 'Hippo's attractive capabilities is a drastic loss in cargo space and relatively high logistical profile, requiring a sizeable investment in support vessels to support it.",,,
hmi_draco_pardon,SHIP,"An old prototype of the Harbringer borne from the engineering standpoint that the Phase Cloak was unfeasible, this vessel has been adopted by the Draco Group as a warship. Able to break enemy formations with its Clarent Bridgehead Device system and a more flexible and sensibly sized armament, this ship is an effect assault vessel. Where the group located this design is unclear, although accusations of Tri-Tachyon influence have been hypothesised by the Hegemony.

Phase Cloaking is an advanced piece of technology, and some individuals within Tri-Tachyon perceived that its widespread implementation would be impossible. This was due to the expense of the drive, the long-term effects of sustained p-space exposure on crew and officers, and the reliability of the cloak itself. Consequently a limited run of 'phaseless' prototypes were produced, however these ships repeatedly ran into problems with their extraneous systems. 

In the case of the Pardon, the Quantum Disruptor was difficult to charge up, as a large part of the system required the temporal detanglement provided by the phase cloak. The Triplet-State Disruptor system was the compromise, which provided similar effects to the Disruptor while not requiring the phase cloak system, and also possessing easier maintenance. To compensate for this the designers added additional ordinance, expanding the middle medium weapon emplacement with a larger mount, converting the hardpoints to missile mounts, and adding two medium energy mounts where the phase cloak drives would normally be placed.  After review, it was determined that while the ship itself was an effective artillery vessel, its poor cost-benefit ratio when compared with the Medusa prevented its widespread usage.

The Draco Group however have removed the system, and filled the ample infrastructure with an overtuned Aegis system interlinked with a phase leap system. When the 'Clarent Bridgehead' system activated, the Aegis vents its arcing as the ship transits. The result is a 'sling-shot' effect, where the ship travels forward in partial p-space while storing up EMP discharge, and on emergence the system releases a cloud of accumulated EMP energy as a storm of EMP arcs. The process is incredibly flux intensive, but it works as a very effective formation breaker.",,,

#CRUISER CRUISER CRUISER,,,,,
,,,,,
hmi_fang_starliner,SHIP,"A Starliner modified by the Fang Society, this vessel has had the crew compartments and cargo replaced with hull reinforcement, weapons, engines and superior flux infrastructure. Surprisingly nimble for its size and packed with weaponry, the craft is also fragile in the face of withering fire. The Rata Apunalada as a result is a suitable bully, able to destroy anything smaller than it with ease, but faltering against determined resistance.",,,
,,,,,
hmi_fang_colossus,SHIP,"At first appearance, this vessel looks no different from a normal Colossus Mk. 3. However, this vessel has been modified and reinforced by the canny engineers of the Fang Society to bear considerably more ordnance. Possessing a concentrated forward arc of ballistic or missile firepower, combined with a functional double fighter bay, this ship can bear a frightening missile strike up close or hit at range with its fighters. However, despite this ample ordinance, the ship itself is incredibly fragile, making it's use a very risky endeavour.",,,
hmi_fang_mora,SHIP,"Modified by the craftier individuals of the Fang Society, this ship bears incredibly refined armour and engine systems. The shields have been replaced with a damper field system to favour the more aggressive combat style of the Fang Society. Further, the weapon mounts has been changed around to focus on a stronger ballistic-based layout, enabling the ship to effectively drill through any ship unlucky enough to be caught by it.

 This class of carrier was commissioned during the same period of carrier-centric Domain naval doctrine as the ubiquitous Talon fighter. Armoured to withstand the fury of battle alongside the Onslaught, the Mora was nonetheless decommissioned en masse as doctrine shifted to favour heavier guns and capital ships flanked by line-cruisers. 

Demilitarized hulls were sold and converted into mobile industrial platforms for use on the frontiers of the Domain. The rugged and eminently adaptable Mora was a common sight in long-range surveying, mining, construction, drone handling, and use as mobile drydocks. Some hulls were even half-buried on alien worlds and used as armoured power-stations and workshops to form the core of new settlements. 

After the Collapse, Mora hulls were re-militarized almost suspiciously rapidly by factions that did not possess dedicated fleet carriers. Today they are an anvil upon which many an unwary Pirate warlord is broken.",,,
hmi_fang_eradicator,SHIP,"This Fang Society modification of the Eradicator is truly deranged. With an Orion Device shoved into the back while still maintaining its armour, this ship is shocking fast and surprisingly resilient.

A resilient design often overlooked by history, the Eradicator-class fast cruiser features powerful dual engine nacelles that allow it to deliver uncompromising firepower and a powerful missile barrage to the weakest point of the enemy battleline - or come to the rescue of valuable assets that have found themselves tactically exposed.

Back in the long cycles of the Domain, a chance accident during a fleet demonstration set one of an Eradicator's engine nacelles into shutdown and the other into overdrive, putting the ship into a terrible spin only stopped by a heroic effort from the engineering crew. Worse than the injuries and casualties suffered was the ship class becoming the laughingstock of a significant portion of the Domain hypermedia sphere. To save face the admiralty quietly assigned all of the Eradicators to frontier duty, far from the fickle attentions of the core sector budget committees. It would take a generation and several difficult fringe rebellion mop-up operations before a new fast-cruiser class model was requested by the Domain Navy to replace the Eradicator's role in front-line battlefleets.",,,
hmi_fang_yowie,SHIP,"A terrifying show of Fang Society ingenuity, the Yowie is an aggressive cruiser-sized phase vessel bearing the infamous Ring Cloak. While the cloak suffers from a long cooldown between phase transitions due to the ring needing to be flushed of abhorrent transition states, the Ring is able to carry vast amounts of mass effectively. The result is a crazed, heavily armoured and armed vessel with surprising mobility, and when crewed aggressively it is one of the most terrifying vessels on the battlescape.

While the Gremlin's phase coil set up is well known for being a truly horrific set up due to the psychological impact it has on crews, the Ring Cloak system is a altogether kinder derivative of the phase coil. While the Ring Cloak requires regular flux redistribution in the coils every time the ship emerges from p-space, the thick structure and sheer bulk of the redistribution system shields the crew from anomalous phase variations while also allowing the ship to temporarily 'bleed' with phase space, allowing temporal acceleration on emergence. This of course makes the vessel more vulnerable when existing p-space, which is the key drawback to the cloak.",,,
,,,,,
hmi_draco_falcon,SHIP,"Modified by the Draco Group, this Falcon analogue has an Aegis EMP Arc System which emits protective EMP arcs depending the ship's flux level. Further, the engine system has been replaced with a missile autoforge vat, enabling sustained missile ouput. The resulting sacrifice of mobility for sustained missile strike potential results in an incredibly nasty if somewhat fragile strike cruiser.

The concept for the Falcon (TT) was to consolidate Shrike hulls, either scavenged or damaged, into Falcons during the Second AI War, preferably on the field. The design exploration was triggered by a hypothetical design which showed a considerably easier to maintain ship could be produced from not only Shrike hulls, but more easily scavenged civilian ships. Regrettably, the ship design was not completed in time to impact the Tri-Tachyon's position during the War. Considering that the Fury had long been in production and occupied a similar niche, and the functionality of assembling from Shrikes was not suitably fulfilled, the project was dead on arrival. However, the presence of speculative Falcon (TT) hulls with a more aggressive, energy-based loadout with an incredibly low supply demand in Tri-Tachyon fleets seems to indicate a possible interest in the ship by covetous Executives. The Draco Group's derivative includes a missile autofac, changing the focus from mobility to missile strike.",,,
hmi_draco_heron,SHIP,"An old prototype of the Heron that became a boondoggle, this vessel has been adopted by the Draco Group as a warship. This ship has an overtuned engine and the Aegis EMP Arc System which emits protective EMP arcs depending the ship's flux level. Where the group located this design is unclear, although accusations of Tri-Tachyon influence have been hypothesised by the Hegemony.

As the Tri-Tachyon Corporation began to pivot it's doctrine towards hit and run tactics during the Second AI War, the Corporation began looking into improving the Heron chassis to supplement Astral carrier groups by the Corporation. However, the project became side-tracked as more and more features were proposed and added to the design. Just before the outbreak of the War, the prototype hull was produced with flexible synergy mounts, a Fighter Teleporter system to quickly retrieve strike vessels for restocking, and numerous alterations that completely altered the superstructure of the vessel. Due to the new bells and whistles added to the design,  upgrading the existing Heron fleet to the new design was impractical, and as the War progressed dedicating any ship production to the design became inefficient. Finally the Tri-Tachyon Corporation gave up on the design entirely. The Heron (TT) was eventually forgotten, apart from the occasional prototype sometimes observed as a curiosity in Tri-Tachyon fleets.",,,
hmi_draco_eagle,SHIP,"Modified by the Draco Group, this ship has an Aegis EMP Arc System which emits protective EMP arcs depending the ship's flux level. Further, the Temporal Device has been removed and replaced with a far more straight-forward High Energy Focus system, turning the ship into a vicious gunship.

This vessel is the result of Executive Madras Kilkenny, a man with too many credits and not enough sense. Desiring a sumptuous warship, he commissioned a Tri-Tachyon enhanced Eagle. At first a standard Eagle design was contemplated with subtle improvements to the weapon and flux systems, however meddling from Madras at the design stage had resulted in an over-engineered monster that almost necessitated a complete redesign of the Eagle from the ground up. One such piece of engineering was an experimental version of the Temporal Shell system from the then in-production Scarab. Considerable revenue streams ran into the vessel's design and construction - some of which were discovered to be embezzled by Madras from other projects. After the resulting asset liquidation by the corruption invigilators, this vessel's design was impounded, and then promptly stolen by hackers. This Draco Group version strips out the Temporal Acceleration system and replaces it with a more straightforward high energy focus, turning the ship into a more easily maintainable and terrifying dangerous gunship.",,,
hmi_draco_champion,SHIP,"A prototypical Champion with an integrated an Aegis EMP Arc System, this ship is a formidably defensive vessel. This ship is often utilized by the Draco Group as a fleet anchor in smaller engagements, denying air space and occupying enemy attention while providing considerable energy or missile-based support.

Desiring a smaller vessel that could utilise the Fortress Shield system, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation considered the Champion chassis. With large armament, good armour and a decent ship size with which to work with, designers picked up the design architecture and set to work. After many design cycles and computational simulations, the design had remained largely unchanged. The simple fact was the Fortress Shield system was too large to install on the vessel - either the circular generator was too small and did not enhance the shield in a meaningful way, or was so large that the ship would split in two under simulated combat conditions. While some upgrades had been implemented in the base design, not much had been done to justify producing it over licensing production from the Persean League. The Champion (TT) design was thus unceremoniously dropped, however a small number of these vessels exist from a test production run, and are highly valued by Collectors. The Draco Champion lacks the Flux Shunt system, although it's unclear if this is because the Group were unable to replicate the system, or if removing it helped streamline the ship's maintenance profile.",,,

hmi_fang_atlas,SHIP,"The Fang Society, utilising a level of engineering even pirates would be deranged, have modified a scavenged Atlas hull for extreme ordinance. Bearing two large missile mounts, three large ballistic mounts and an Ammo Feeder system, this makeshift gunboat can deliver a truly staggering damage output. Able to spew out an absurd amount of firepower, and with a surprisingly cheap maintenance profile, the defensive capabilities of the ship are truly awful.",,,
hmi_fang_retribution,SHIP,"A Retribution class hacked and modified by the Fang Society, this vessel bears an additional large mount, redistributed medium sized mounts, and a garish paint job. While bearing the archaic Orion Drive for mobility and packing a touch more firepower, this ship still suffers from poor armour.

An ancient but unvenerated class, the Retribution is an extreme battlecruiser design which dates to the renaissance of military experimentation during the first consolidation period of the Domain. It sacrifices armor for firepower and tremendous speed for its size class via a nearly unique implementation of ""Orion Drive"" technology which was considered an archaic curiosity even then.

The physical stress inflicted upon both human flesh and ship components by the propulsive jolts made the Retribution an unpopular ship in the Domain Armada, one of only a handful of opinions shared whole-heartedly by crew and officers alike. Only a handful of examples were ever deployed by the Armada proper, the Retribution finding more use among frontier mercenaries and pirate-hunters that relied upon unexpected bursts of speed and hyper-aggressive tactics.",,,
hmi_fang_onslaught,SHIP,"Unexpectedly fast with an Orion Drive, combined with thick armour, a Damper Field defensive system and upsized ordinance, this Fang-derivative Onslaught is a truly terrifying predator to face.

Typically the Fang Society prefer to use smaller, lighter, faster craft to get in amongst the enemy and tear them to shreds. Only very rarely will the Society consider scavenging a capital ship, perhaps as a show of predatory dominance or simply for the pragmatic desire to have a heavily armoured flagship. The venerable Onslaught-class is one of these rare vessels. Hegemony records confirm that three Onslaughts have been captured by the Fang Society previously; the Midnight Dawn, the Vigilant and the Caspian. The Caspian (renamed Devouring God) was destroyed during a major Fang Hunt over Eventide, however the other two hulls are still active. 

Based on surviving accounts and the wreck of the Caspian, it has been determined that the surviving Onslaughts have been drastically down-armoured and internally reinforced to accomodate the Orion Drive. As deranged as this sounds, surprisingly clever engineering solutions have been integrated to ensure that activating the Orion Drive doesn't cause long-term damage to the crew, let alone turn the crew into paste on system activation. This sudden speed, combined with the lighter chassis makes the Onslaught frighteningly fast. 

Further, the presence of a damper field drastically improves the survivability of the ship once it has launched itself into an enemy formation. There are also further tweaks to weapon mounts to ensure most ballistic mounts can now fire forward, while upsizing several weapon mounts. An integrated firing solution system has been integrated into the hull, to drastically improve the longetivity of the weapons under fire. 

The result is a ship that can get up close very fast, and continue to dump excessive firepower even under heavy fire. It is little wonder why only one of these deranged vessels has been destroyed, and the two remain at large.",,,
,,,,,
hmi_draco_forgiveness,SHIP,"An old prototype of the Doom borne from the engineering standpoint that the Phase Cloak was unfeasible, this vessel has been adopted by the Draco Group as a warship. The combination of a Clarent Bridgehead Device system and two large energy mounts produces a truly fearsome assault package. Where the Draco Group managed to secure such a terrifying attack craft is a matter of extensive debate, as it seems unlikely a possible Tri-Tachyon collaboration would relinquish such a vessel to their Draco catspaws.

Phase Cloaking is an advanced piece of technology, and some individuals within Tri-Tachyon perceived that its widespread implementation would be impossible. This was due to the expense of the drive, the long-term effects of sustained p-space exposure on crew and officers, and the reliability of the cloak itself. Consequently a limited run of 'phaseless' prototypes were produced, however these ships repeatedly ran into problems with their extraneous systems.

In the case of the Forgiveness, the existing Mine Strike system was unable to teleport mines onto the target, as a large part of the system required the phase cloak to transport the explosive charge. A more prototypical analogue of the system was implemented which was easier to maintain, but its performance left a lot to be desired. To compensate for this the designers added additional ordinance, adding two large energy and two medium energy mounts where the phase cloak drives would normally be placed. Only a very, very limited number of this vessel were ever produced, as it was a derivative of an already secret vessel before review, and after it was determined that the Doom was simply more effective in its role despite the Forgiveness's fearsome firepower and surprisingly light maintenance profile. The ship, however, is still seen rarely in Tri-Tachyon fleets under the control of the more covetous, collection-inclined Senior Executives.

The Draco Group however have removed the system, and filled the ample infrastructure with an overtuned Aegis system interlinked with a phase leap system. When the 'Clarent Bridgehead' system activated, the Aegis vents its arcing as the ship transits. The result is a 'sling-shot' effect, where the ship travels forward in partial p-space while storing up EMP discharge, and on emergence the system releases a cloud of accumulated EMP energy as a storm of EMP arcs. The process is incredibly flux intensive, but it works as a very effective formation breaker.",,,
hmi_draco_ionos,SHIP,"Modified by the Draco Group, this ship has an Aegis EMP Arc System which emits protective EMP arcs depending the ship's flux level. Further, the phase leap infrastructure has been removed, and replaced with weaponry, flux conduits, an improved engine and a simpler High Energy Focus system. Surprisingly mobile and suitably overarmed, the Draco Group's Ionos is shockingly powerful, but somewhat lacking on the defensive.

Designed to provide tactical flexibility to the discerning commander, the Ionos can act both as a close support vessel with its large energy mount, or as an attack vessel with its generous hardpoint layout and High Energy Focus system. However, to accommodate the large turret in the relatively small frame, cut-backs prevented weapons mounted in the large turret from aiming forwards, thus in order to use the mount the ship itself needs to physically rotate, preventing simultaneous use with the forward hardpoints. Consequently this ship can occupy either a close support or assault vessel role, but never at the same time.",,,
hmi_draco_legion,SHIP,"Slow, lumbering, but well shielded, this Draco derivative of the Legion acts as a support vessel for Draco Group fleets. Able to strike with fighters and bombers, provide close support with its long range energy weapons and protect itself with an Aegis EMP Arc System, this ship is a tough nut to approach, let alone crack. 

No one is quite sure where this design came from. The complete reworking of an armoured, ballistic-based, aggressive capital into a shield-defended, energy-based, long range support vessel would've involved considerable time and effort. This implies that this Legion analogue had existed before the Collapse, as only the Domain would have been able to produce it, but this ship does not show up on any Domain catalogue or registry. Speculation by Hegemony analysts suggest that this craft might be an existing prototype, or possibly a Tri-Tachyon black ops project, or  even a new unique craft made by the Draco Group.

This hulking vessel is the pride of the Draco Group's spacefleet, only spotted in very rare circumstances buried in the largest of Draco fleets. Most of its characteristics are only known through accounts, as none of these craft have been captured in combat. High energy arcing from the vessel indicates the presence of the Aegis EMP emitter, while the weapon ranges comparable to a Paragon indicate the presence of an advanced targeting computer. The shields take longer to grind through, indicating either improved shield efficiency or a deeper flux pool, but when the shields are down it is much easier to damage the substructure, implying thinner armour. The ship also does not appear to move in short bursts like the normal Legion, instead mines emerge from space and arc violently to nearby targets, indicating the presence of an adjusted mine strike system. Besides these major differences, it appears the flight decks work in a similar fashion to the base model.

The result is a solid fleet anchor, able to snipe at enemy vessels from range and punish all those who approach, while also enduring considerable damage through its shields. However, it is still a slow ship, and its weapons are focused forward; strong flanking attacks should be enough to threaten the ship. This of course will be difficult considering it's mine strike system, and how this ship is never found without an accompanying fleet to protect its flanks, necessitating the usage of excessive firepower to attack this vessel.",,,

A rather strange design, the Wolf (Assault) was a work of love by a completely unknown ship designer. This is because the design was stolen from the designer by another designer, which was then stolen again by yet another designer. Once lawsuits were made and settled by a startling amount of bloody assassinations and reprisals, the whole matter was left in the air as to who actually had the rights to the ship design. With the company at large unwilling to pursue an intensive legal matter over what could be argued to be an inferior Wolf design, the hull was consigned to obscurity. However, acquisition of the ship design has become something of a right of passage for hackers within the Tri-Tachyon Corporation, and as a result the hull design is passed on and quietly produced  quasi-legally for curious ship designers and avid collectors. ",,,
tempest_7,SHIP,"An incredibly rare experimental version of the Tempest, this early model is focused around its unique phase drone.

Lacking the  missile hardpoint and supplementary ship system of later models, the entire focus of the Tempest (Mk. VII) was to be a complex drone autofactory. This early prototypical Tempest Drone is equipped with a phase cloak, enabling it to nimbly dance around the battlefield, quickly striking at enemies before dancing away, while also providing limited point defence for the Tempest. This focus on the drone can often leave the Tempest itself vulnerable to counter attack. Often highly sought after by both avid collectors and experienced Tri-Tachyon executives.",,,
tempest_8,SHIP,"A rare prototype of the Tempest possessing a truly mythical reputation, this version has a truly fearsome wingman drone capable of crippling enemies with EMP and allowing for easy follow-up attacks.

The Tempest Mk. VIII was constructed with the idea of mass production without using complicated phase drone assemblies. The new drone system allowed for the inclusion of an active flare launcher and a small missile mounting, improving the combat ability of the base Tempest. Further, the ion pulser armed drone proves to be incredibly effective at disabling and damaging targets. These systems combined, however, caused considerable strain the  existing ship systems, which made it very difficult to run for extended periods, as well as causing continual problems off the battlefield. While this model never made it into mass production, several prototype models were produced, and are hungrily sought after by not only Tri-Tachyon executives and collectors, but also just about every single skilled pilot in the sector.",,,
tempest_9,SHIP,"A highly-sought after analogue of the Tempest, this rather simple yet horrifying variant swaps out the Termination Sequence for a High Energy Focus system.

The penultimate prototype made before the final Tempest-class, this version was produced as a part of the general trend of taking the Terminator Drone away from the offensive role, and keeping the it closer to the vessel for self defense. This change, combined with simplification of the drone system, allowed for the regular construction and control of a second Terminator Drone. The close proximity of the now doubled drones drastically improved the survivability of the Tempest hull, however members within the design team felt that with this change towards defense the craft lacked the offensive punch of its predecessors. So, with selected overtuning, this prototype was produced with a High Energy Focus system to briefly enhance the ship's weapons. However, this overtuning of the ship's weapons was hazardous to the Tempest's systems, causing its combat ability to crater after extended deployment. Eventually the Termination Sequence was produced as a suitable alternative for high alpha damage attacks and keeping the Tempest functional for longer in combat, however a couple of these Mk.

scarab_prototype,SHIP,"An incredibly rare modification of the Scarab borne from the engineering standpoint that the Temporal Shell system was unfeasible and constructed from a bureaucratic mix-up, this vessel bears heavier ordinance and a phase skimmer.

 During the development of the Scarab, there was a period of time where the feasibility of using the temporal device came into question. The problem lay less in the functionality of the device, and more in the manufacture of key components of the engine, meaning that even limited runs of the vessel would number in the single digits. During this particularly troublesome time, several designers and engineers attached to the project created an alternative Scarab hull comprised of far more common components, just in case the project fell through. Luckily the production issues of the Temporal Shell technology were ironed out and the sketched design was consigned to the archives. However, during a later production run of the Scarab, the constructor file associated with this theoretical prototype was accidentally used instead of the pre-existing Scarab. Tritachyon contractors on-site, realising they had half-completed hulls of an unfinished design when they should be producing a highly refined and expensive hull, quickly remade the hull on the fly to create this version of the Scarab. In a moment of sheer innovation and gut-wrenching anxiety, the contractors produced a surprisingly robust hull that replaced the temporal device with a phase skimmer, and six of the front mounts with two medium-sized mounts. The contractors were still charged with stealing the existing temporal engine technology and liquidated accordingly, with all the hulls produced seized for refitting with the appropriate ship system. Rather curiously, this hull very rarely appears from time to time in Tri-Tachyon fleets, whether as one of the assets taken from the original project, or completely new hulls based on the existing slapdash design.",,,

Consequently a limited run of 'phaseless' prototypes were produced, however these ships repeatedly ran into problems with their extraneous systems. 

In the case of the Appeasement, the Entropy Amplifier was difficult to charge up, as a large part of the system required the time dilation effect provided by the phase cloak. The logistically simpler Entropy Accelerator system was the compromise, which provided similar effects to the Accelerator while not requiring the phase cloak system.  After review, it was determined that the ship itself lacked the punch of the normal Afflictor for rather nebulous benefits. The Appeasement-class was officially decommissioned and converted into Afflictors, however several hulls were taken by paranoid Tri-Tachyon Executives who were still sceptical of the long-term effects of spending time inside p-space, and they are very occasionally spotted in Tri-Tachyon fleets.",,,

The Hammerhead is a well-respected vessel due to its versatile ballistic loadout and good staying power.

Sometimes the project itself had its funding redirected to other sources, other times the project itself was just a front for embezzlement, and yet other times the modifications did not meet the design goals set out by the Executive Design Committee. The Hammerhead (TT) only passed the prototype stage when a Mayasuran with a deep affinity and love of the Hammerhead chassis came up with a fairly workable design independently of Tri-Tachyon attempts. She was quickly recruited, and she now heads the Hammerhead (TT) development project, of which this is a prototype model.

While the Scarab was considered to be a rather fantastic experimental platform for the Temporal Shell device, several designers and pilots within the Tri-Tachyon Corporation disagreed, as they determined that the decentralised weapon layout of the Scarab simply did not harness the full power of the system. To refine the system in depth, key designers examined the Shrike hull as a possible hull for Temporal Shell implementation. After several design passes this version of the Shrike was created, with a very limited run of test models produced. The resulting hull was an absolute horror to behold on the field of battle, however using the Temporal Shell device on such a comparatively large vessel gravely stressed the ship, drastically reducing the operational time of the vessel. Further, creating a Temporal Shell device for this sized vessel is incredibly difficult, necessitating far too much production time for a relatively small number of vessels with limited combat capability. With this in mind the project was put on temporary, and then permanent hold. Despite this, the very few hulls produced during the testing phase were bought by Tri-Tachyon Executives, and even today very rarely show up in Tri-Tachyon fleets and markets.",,,

The Triplet-State Disruptor system was the compromise, which provided similar effects to the Disruptor while not requiring the phase cloak system, and also possessing easier maintenance. To compensate for this the designers added (arguably too much) ordinance, expanding the middle medium weapon emplacement with a larger mount, converting two medium hardpoints to missiles, and adding two medium energy mounts where the phase cloak drives would normally be placed.  After review, it was determined that while the ship itself was an effective artillery vessel, its poor cost-benefit ratio when compared with the Medusa prevented its final implementation. Ships from the limited run are in high demand amongst Tri-Tachyon Executives however, and they are occasionally spotted in Tri-Tachyon fleets piloted by proud and smug higher-ups.",,,

During the prototypical stages of design, Tri-Tachyon engineers explored a variety of routes to increase the effectiveness of the Aurora hull. This prototypical hull focused on improving the fire output and range of the ship to create an artillery vessel comparable to a miniature Paragon. While the addition of an improved targeting system, modifications to the weapon output to improve range, and the inclusion of a large energy mount made the ship a better damage dealer, the hull was easily overwhelmed when encountering many smaller craft. Further, additional capacitance could not be added, nor the formidable Fortress Shield be installed, both due to limitations in the hull and expense. While the current Aurora, with its nimble engine system, became the cruiser of choice, a few of these original prototypes were still made and put into military service.

Substantially heavier and more expensive to maintain and deploy, the ship possessed exceptional flux capacity and superb shield integrity. While the ship itself was adequate for Prince's vision, widespread implementation was never carried out as a ship designed to get stuck into the enemy simply did not fit within the prevailing idea of mobile warfare within the company.

However, the project became side-tracked as more and more features were proposed and added to the design. Just before the outbreak of the War, the prototype hull was produced with flexible synergy mounts, a Fighter Teleporter system to quickly retrieve strike vessels for restocking, and numerous alterations that completely altered the superstructure of the vessel. Due to the new bells and whistles added to the design,  upgrading the existing Heron fleet to the new design was impractical, and as the War progressed dedicating any ship production to the design became inefficient.

The design exploration was triggered by a hypothetical design which showed a considerably easier to maintain ship could be produced from not only Shrike hulls, but more easily scavenged civilian ships. Regrettably, the ship design was not completed in time to impact the Tri-Tachyon's position during the War. Considering that the Fury had long been in production and occupied a similar niche, and the functionality of assembling from Shrikes was not suitably fulfilled, the project was dead on arrival.

This vessel is the result of Executive Madras Kilkenny, a man with too many credits and not enough sense. Desiring a sumptuous warship, he commissioned a Tri-Tachyon enhanced Eagle. At first a standard Eagle design was contemplated with subtle improvements to the weapon and flux systems, however meddling from Madras at the design stage had resulted in an over-engineered monster that almost necessitated a complete redesign of the Eagle from the ground up. One such piece of engineering was an experimental version of the Temporal Shell system from the then in-production Scarab. Considerable revenue streams ran into the vessel's design and construction - some of which were discovered to be embezzled by Madras from other projects. After the resulting asset liquidation by the corruption invigilators, this vessel's design was impounded, and then promptly stolen by hackers.

Desiring a smaller vessel that could utilise the Fortress Shield system, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation considered the Champion chassis. With large armament, good armour and a decent ship size with which to work with, designers picked up the design architecture and set to work. After many design cycles and computational simulations, the design had remained largely unchanged. The simple fact was the Fortress Shield system was too large to install on the vessel - either the circular generator was too small and did not enhance the shield in a meaningful way, or was so large that the ship would split in two under simulated combat conditions. While some upgrades had been implemented in the base design (including a Flux Shunt system from the Monitor), not much had been done to justify producing it over licensing production from the Persean League.

However, with the superior mobility afforded by its skimmer system combined with capital-grade flux systems, the Ionos is a surprisingly nimble and dangerous foe to face.

 The Ionos-class is a vessel shrouded in mystery. Its development at first appeared to be a straightforward improvement on a relatively new Domain Navy design from before the collapse. Over time, its developmental history got increasingly hazy and unclear, until the First AI War, wherein the class's development history vanishes completely from known records. Recently the ship has been spotted in Tri-Tachyon fleets, although its rarity has prevented a full examination of the differences from the old design. In fact, some Hegemony analysts consider the current day Ionos a completely different design from the original in development before the War, and only keep the hull's classification for simplicity.

The Ionos is, theoretically, the largest vessel that can safely utilise a phase skimmer without disappearing into phase space or suffering long term effects on crew. It is primarily because of the oversized skimmer device that the vessel is so disproportionately expensive to maintain.",,,

hmi_sv_trice,WEAPON,"The Blink is a modification of the Gazer missile, with a powerful anti-shield strike due to overtuning of the graviton effect. A solid DEM packing substantial anti-shield burst, however the beam often glances off armour and hull and suffers from a short range.

""Captured weaponry bears similarity to pre-existing 'Gazer' payload from PL sources [ref rep HEGINT/KAZRN-K10-4]. Payload has drastically increased graviton shield-disruption effect. Due to simplicity of alteration, HEGINT consensus uncertain of TT involvement or native innovation.""- classified report to The High Hegemon",,,

""Weapon is a DEM style missile with sharp kinetic payload. Has clearly been sourced from PL [ref rep HEGINT/KAZRN-K10-4] before mod by suspected TT involvement [ref rep HEGINT/MAXIOS-L444-22a]. Unclear how weapon came into use by DG. Conclusion: Possible collusion between PL and TT in DG formation.""- classified report to The High Hegemon",,,
