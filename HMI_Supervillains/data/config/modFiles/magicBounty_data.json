        "job_name": "Monster Hunt",
        "job_description": "This mission looks like it was copied from an internal memo from the Hegemony, and then hastily thrown onto the Board. According to the report, there was a momentous battle between the Hegemony and the Fang Society over Luddic Church space, which resulted in the Society attack being scattered. During their flight, a particular ship was identified leading their retreat: the terrible legendary Onslaught-class ==$shipName==.\nOriginally the Caspian, this ship was lost in a previous engagement between the Hegemony and the Fang Society, who then recovered the ship and outfitted according to their tastes. Since then, the ==$shipName== has become a harbinger of doom and terror, always at the head of a huge fleet of Fang vessels, harvesting and devouring entire planetary populations.\nThe report gives way to hacked-in information about sightings of the ==$shipName== all across the sector - and now the most recent update has good information of their current location, along with a postive pittance of a bounty provided to whoever can take down this beast.\nBelow is a list of tallies of other mercenaries that have gone after this catch - and failed. The number is haunting large - looks like more than money is motivating folks to take this fleet down.",
        "job_intel_success": "The money is sent on to you, accompanied by a surprisingly heartfelt message of thanks for destroying the Fang fleet and letting the memory of the Caspian to rest – along with a brief post-script to not make too much noise about the bounty and exactly where the money came from.",
        "job_intel_expired": "There is no message, no acknowledgement of failure - but you feel the next time this bounty emerges on the Board, it’ll have one more tally added to the bottom.",
