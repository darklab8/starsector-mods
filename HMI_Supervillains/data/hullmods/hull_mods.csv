Draco Group Fleetship,draco,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.draco,"The Draco Group utilises a unique shield generator that utilises energy from built-up flux to power a passive defensive EMP system called the Aegis EMP Arc System. This technology emits %s.

However, this conversion causes several problems with the ship systems. First, shields take an additional %s damage as a by-product of the energy conversion effect. Further, the shield generators interfere with energy leaving the vessel, reducing the range of energy weapons above %s. Finally, the conversion process interferes with autofactory function, decreasing the replacement rate of fighters by  %s.

To compensate for these drawbacks and enable better usage of the EMP system, the engines have been overtuned to increase maneuverability by %s, max speed by %s/%s/%s/%s depending on hullsize, and active venting has been improved by %s.","Shields have been compromised, but speed and active venting has been improved.
